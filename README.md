# _"Pizza-Order" - End of Week Four project_

#### _Practice using Objects, Constructors and Prototypes_

#### By _**Chris Quattrocchi**_

## Description

_End of Week Four project. The goal is to use constructors and prototypes to receive user input and calculate/display the cost of a pizza given certain criteria.

## Specifications
-input                      output
 SM Pizza no toppings       $8
 MD Pizza no toppings       $10
 LG Pizza no toppings       $12
 XL Pizza no toppings       $14

 Meats:
 None                       +$0
 Pepperoni                  +$1
 Sausage                    +$2
 Chicken                    +$2

 Veggies:
 None                       +$0
 Olives                     +$1
 Green Pepperoni            +$2
 Onion                      +$3

 SPECS I DIDN'T THINK TO WRITE INITIALLY:
 values for input selections need to be converted into something readable before being displayed. instead of "pizza-sm no-meat olive-veg" it should look like "You'll be having a small pizza with no meat and olives."

 input          output

 sm-pizza       "You'll be having a small pizza"

 no-meat        " with no meat"

 onion-veg      " and onions."

 example:
 LG Pepperoni and Green Pepper Pizza cost = $15
 string = "You'll be having a large pizza with pepperoni and green pepper"

 TODO LIST:
  Build form, make sure the script is identifying the inputs correctly

  Build Pizza constructor to build new pizza Objects

  Build Prototype to calculate price of pizza objects created by constructor

  Display information to user (output) when they click submit, based on size and toppings.

  Add functionality to build a list of pizzas, click to display full info, and click to redo an order by removing the list item

  Style

* _clone repository_
* _(or) extract zip file_
* _open index.html in your web browser_
* _alternatively, follow the GH-Pages link:https://cappyvee.github.io/Pizza-w4p/
